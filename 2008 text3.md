In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of the only three players in the 
National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last 
season, however, he would have been one of 42. **The bodies playing major** 
**professional sports** have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have 
been **more than** willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, 
longer frames. 
The trend in sports, though, may be **obscuring** an **unrecognized** reality: 
Americans have **generally** stopped growing. Though **typically** about two inches taller 
now than 140 years ago, today's people — especially those born to families who have 
lived in the U.S. for many generations — apparently reached their limit in the early 
1960s. And they aren't likely to get any taller. "In the general population today, at 
this **genetic**, envirornnental level, we've pretty much gone as far as we can go," says 
**anthropologist** William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of 
NBA players, their increase in height appears to **result from** the increasingly common 
practice of **recruiting** players from all over the world. 
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and 
nutrients — **notably,** protein — to feed **expanding tissues**. At the start of the 20th century, 
under-nutrition and childhood **infection**s **got in the way**. But as diet and health 
improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about **an 
inch and a half **every 20 years, a **pattern** known as the **secular** trend in height. Yet 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height — **5'9"** for 
men, 5'4" for women — hasn't really changed since 1960. 
**Genetically** speaking, there are advantages to avoiding **substantial** height. During 
childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. 
**Moreover**, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and 
back continue to struggle with **bipedal posture **and cannot easily withstand repeated 
**strain imposed by oversize limbs**. "There are some real constraints that are set by **the 
genetic architecture of the individual organism**," says anthropologist William Leonard 
ofNorthwestem University. 
Genetic maximums can change, but don't expect this to happen soon. Claire C. 
Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures 
that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit **recruits** without **alteration**. She 
says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed 
**for some time**. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a 
piece of equipment, **Gordon says that by and large**, "you could use today's data and 
feel fairly confident."

    In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of the only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. **The bodies playing major professional sports** have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been **more than** willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

    #### 翻译
    在20世纪60年代初，威尔特·张伯伦（Wilt Chamberlain）是全美篮球协会（NBA）中身高超过七英尺的三名球员之一。然而，如果他上个赛季还在打球，他将是42名这样的球员之一。**参与主要职业体育的运动员身体**多年来发生了巨大的变化，管理者也**非常**愿意调整球队制服，以适应越来越多的身体更大、更长的运动员。

    #### 重点词汇
    - **bodies**: 身体
    - **major professional sports**: 主要职业体育
    - **more than**: 非常、超过

    #### 经典搭配
    - **more than willing**: 非常愿意。这里表示管理者非常愿意为了适应运动员日益增长的身体尺寸来调整制服。

    #### 理解难点
    - **The bodies playing major professional sports**: 这个表达方式比较特殊，用“身体”来代表参与主要职业体育的运动员。这样表达强调了身体特点和身体变化的重要性。

Though **typically** about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today's people — especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations — apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren't likely to get any taller.

    #### 翻译
    然而，体育界的这一趋势可能**掩盖**了一个**未被认识到的**现实：美国人**通常**已经停止了身高的增长。尽管现在的人比140年前高了大约两英寸，但尤其是那些出生于在美国生活了多代的家庭的人，显然在20世纪60年代初就已经达到了他们的身高极限。而且他们不太可能会再长高了。

    #### 重点词汇
    - **obscuring**: 掩盖
    - **unrecognized**: 未被认识到的
    - **generally**: 通常
    - **typically**: 通常地，典型地

    #### 经典搭配
    - **obscuring an unrecognized reality**: 掩盖了一个未被认识到的现实。这里意味着体育界的身高增长趋势可能让人们忽视了一个事实，即美国人的身高增长已经停止。

    #### 理解难点
    - **generally stopped growing**: "通常已经停止了身高的增长"，这里的“通常”可能让人困惑。它是用来指出，尽管有特殊情况，但大多数美国人的身高增长已经停止。

    #### 翻译
    “在当今的一般人群中，从这个**基因**、环境水平来看，我们基本上已经达到了极限，”来自赖特州立大学的**人类学家**威廉·卡梅伦·楚姆莱（William Cameron Chumlea）说。在NBA球员的情况下，他们身高的增加似乎是由于越来越普遍的从全球各地**招募**球员的做法所**导致的**。

But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about **an inch and a half** every 20 years, a **pattern** known as the **secular** trend in height.

    #### 翻译
    生长，通常在20岁以后就停止，需要卡路里和营养物质 —— **特别是**蛋白质 —— 来滋养**不断扩张的组织**。在20世纪初，营养不良和儿童**感染**是障碍因素。但随着饮食和健康的改善，儿童和青少年的平均身高每20年增加约**一英寸半**，这一**模式**被称为身高的**世俗**趋势。

    #### 翻译
    从基因角度来讲，避免过高的身高是有优点的。在分娩过程中，体型较大的婴儿通过生殖道更加困难。**更何况**，即使人类已经走立了数百万年，我们的脚和背依然难以适应**两足行走的姿态**，并不能轻易承受**由过大肢体造成的持续压力**。

    #### 重点词汇

    - **Moreover**: 更何况，此外
    - **bipedal posture**: 两足行走的姿态

    #### 翻译
    基因上的极限是可以改变的，但别指望这会很快发生。Claire C. Gordon，马萨诸塞州纳蒂克陆军研究中心的高级人类学家，确保90%的制服和工作站能够适应**新兵**而无需**改动**。她表示，与篮球制服不同，军队制服的长度已经有一段时间**没有变化了**。如果你需要预测近期人类的身高以设计某种设备，**总体而言，戈登说**，“你可以使用现今的数据，并且相当有信心”。

    #### 重点词汇
    - **recruits**: 新兵
    - **alteration**: 改动
    - **for some time**: 已经有一段时间
