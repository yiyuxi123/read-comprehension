In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52, was nearly **toothless**. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his **jaw**—having extracted them from the mouths of his **slave**s.

**That’s a far different image from** the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently,many historians have begun to focus on the role slavery played in the lives of **the founding generation.** They have been **spurred** **in part** by DNA evidence **made available in 1998**, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years **have** scholars **examined** history **from the bottom up**. Works of several historians reveal the moral **compromise**s made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s **infancy.** More **significantly**, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong—and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say, the founders were **hampered** by the culture of their time. **While** Washington and Jefferson privately expressed **distaste** for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic **bedrock** of the country they helped to create.

**For one thing**, the South could not afford to **part with** its slaves. Owning slaves was “like having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of *An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America*. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “**peculiar institution**,” including a **clause** that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of **congressional representation**.

The three-fifths **formula** handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by **inflating** the votes of the southern states in the **Electoral College**. Once in office, Jefferson **extended** slavery with the Louisiana **Purchase** in 1803; the new land was **carved into** 13 states, including three slave states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children—though not Hemings herself or his **approximatel**y 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that *all* men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the **Revolutionary War,** overcame the strong **opposition** of his **relatives** to **grant** his slaves their freedom in his **will**. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

### 翻译
在1784年，乔治·华盛顿52岁，距离他成为美国总统还有五年时间，他几乎已经**没有牙齿了**。因此，他雇了一名牙医，从他的**奴隶们**的口中提取了九颗牙齿，并移植到了他自己的**下巴**上。

### 重点词汇

### 翻译
这与大多数人从历史书上记住的砍樱桃树的乔治有很大的不同。但最近，许多历史学家开始关注奴隶制在**开国一代**生活中的作用。他们部分地受到了1998年公开的DNA证据的**推动**，这些证据几乎肯定地证明了托马斯·杰斐逊与他的奴隶萨莉·海明斯至少生了一个孩子。而且，只有在过去的30年里，学者们才从**底层**开始**审视**历史。几位历史学家的著作揭示了这个国家早期领导人所做的道德**妥协**和这个国家**初期**的脆弱性质。更**重要的是**，他们认为许多开国元勋知道奴隶制是错误的——然而大多数人几乎没有采取措施来反对它。

### 重点词汇

- **compromise**: 在这里的“妥协”是指开国一代在面对奴隶制这个道德问题时所作出的妥协。
- **infancy**: “初期”，在这里指的是美国作为一个新生国家在开国初期的脆弱状态。

## 段落三

### 原文
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were **hampered** by the culture of their time. **While** Washington and Jefferson privately expressed **distaste** for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic **bedrock** of the country they helped to create.

### 翻译
历史学家们说，超过任何事情，开国元勋们受到了他们那个时代文化的**限制**。虽然华盛顿和杰斐逊私下里对奴隶制表示了**厌恶**，但他们也明白，这是他们帮助创建的国家的政治和经济**基础**的一部分。

### 重点词汇
- **hampered**: 限制
- **distaste**: 厌恶
- **bedrock**: 基础

### 理解难点
- **hampered by the culture of their time**: 被他们那个时代的文化限制。这里说的是开国元勋在一定程度上由于当时的社会文化背景而没有能力或意愿全面废除奴隶制。
- **bedrock**: “基础”，这里是说奴隶制是他们创建的美国的政治和经济基础的一部分。

The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “**peculiar institution**,” including a **clause** that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of **congressional representation**.

### 翻译
首先，南方不能承受失去奴隶的后果。拥有奴隶就“像是有一个大的银行账户”，Wiencek这样说，他是*一个不完美的神：乔治·华盛顿、他的奴隶和美国的创建*一书的作者。没有对这一“**特殊制度**”的保护，包括一个**条款**规定一个奴隶为一个人的三分之五，用于**国会代表**的目的，南方各州是不会签署宪法的。

### 重点词汇

- **part with**: 失去

- **congressional representation**: “国会代表”的目的，在这里特指一个奴隶被计算为一个人的三分之五用于确定国会代表名额的规定。

Once in office, Jefferson **extended** slavery with the Louisiana **Purchase** in 1803; the new land was **carved into** 13 states, including three slave states.

### 翻译
并且这些政治家的政治生涯依赖于**奴隶制**。三分之五的**公式**在1800年总统选举中给了杰斐逊一个微弱的胜利，通过**增加**南方各州在**选举人团**中的选票。一旦上任，杰斐逊通过1803年的路易斯安那**购地**来**扩大**奴隶制；新土地被**划分为**13个州，其中包括三个奴隶州。
