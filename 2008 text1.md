While still **catching up to** men in some **sphere**s of modem life, **women appear to** 
**be way ahead in at least one undesirable category.** "Women are particularly 
**susceptible** to developing **depression and anxiety disorders** **in response to** stress 
compared to men," according to Dr. Yehuda, chief **psychiatrist** at New York's 
**Veteran's** **Administration** Hospital. 
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow 
affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the **trigger** 
**chemicals** than **do** males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when 
**stressed-out** female **rats** had their **ovaries** (the female **reproductive** organs) removed, 
their chemical responses became equal to those of the males. 
Adding to a woman's increased **dose** of stress chemicals, **are her** increased 
"opportunities" for stress. "It's not necessarily that women don't **cope** as well. It's 
just that they have so much more to cope with," says Dr. Y ehuda. "Their **capacity** for 
**tolerating** stress may even be greater than men's," she **observes**, "it's just that they're 
dealing with so many more things that they become **worn out** from it more **visibly** and 
sooner." 
Dr. Y ehuda notes another difference between the sexes. "I think that the kinds of 
things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a **chronic** or repeated nature. 
Men go to war and are exposed to **combat** stress. Men are exposed to more acts of 
random physical violence. The kinds of **interpersonal violence** that women are 
exposed to tend to be in **domestic** situations**, by, unfortunately,** parents or other 
family members, a**nd they tend not to be one-shot deals**. The **wear-and-tear** that 
comes from these longer relationships can be quite **devastating**." 
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and **gave birth to a son**, but was **determined** **to** 
finish college. "I struggled a lot to get the college degree. **I was living in so much** 
**frustration that that was my escape,** to go to school, and get ahead and do better." Later, 
her marriage ended and she became a single mother. "It's the hardest thing to take care 
of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car **payment**, and pay the **debt**. I lived 
from **paycheck to paycheck.**" 
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. 
But most women today are coping with a lot of **obligations**, with few breaks, and 
feeling the **strain.** Alvarez's experience **demonstrates** the importance of finding ways 
to **diffuse** stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

## 翻译
动物和人类的研究都显示，性激素以某种方式影响压力反应，导致在相同条件下，受压力的女性会产生更多的**触发化学物质**。在几项研究中，当**压力过大**的雌性**老鼠**去除了它们的**卵巢**（女性的**生殖器官**）后，它们的化学反应变得与男性相同。

### 第三段

#### 原文
Adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased "opportunities" for stress.

#### 翻译
增加女性压力化学物质剂量的，还有她面对更多的“压力机会”。

#### 重点词汇
- dose: 剂量
- opportunities: 机会
- stress: 压力

#### 经典搭配
- increased dose of stress chemicals: 增加的压力化学物质剂量
- opportunities for stress: 压力机会

#### 理解难点
- 这句话使用了倒装结构，正常的句子结构应为 "Her increased 'opportunities' for stress are adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals." 倒装是为了强调或者增加句子的表现力。

#### 句子结构
这是一种倒装句结构，正常顺序应该是："Her increased 'opportunities' for stress are adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals." 在这里，"Adding to a woman's increased dose of stress chemicals" 是主语的补充说明，而 "are her increased 'opportunities' for stress" 是真正的主语和谓语。
